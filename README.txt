Make sure you have steam online before starting the game!
It currently supports offline (nonsteam), but its still being dev..

Finaly make sure you have XNA Redist 4.0.
If you don't use the xnafx40_redist installer to install it or get it at microsoft!

The game is still in ALPHA. It may crash a lot.
If you have any minigames ideas please send me a message at my youtube channel or make a post at my website.
